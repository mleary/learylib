The goal of **learylib** is to easily manage a few personal functions and themes I find useful.  A secondary goal is to explore package development in R, using **pkgdown**, **usethis**, & **devtools** to practice fully building out a package. 


## Installation

You can install the latest version of learylib from my Github with the **devtools** package.  Given the limited scope & use of **learylib**, it will always live on Github.

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mleary/learylib")

```

## Usage

Using `theme_leary` with the `mtcars` dataset.

``` {r example1}
library(learylib)
library(ggplot2)
## basic example code

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
     geom_point() +
     labs(title = "A basic example plot",
          subtitle = "A little more detail in subtitle?") +
     theme_leary()
```

Using `see_pkg_funcs` to see all the functions within a package.

``` {r example2}
library(learylib)

see_pkg_funcs(learylib)
```

## Resources used

Shout out to Hadley Wickham, Jenny Bryan, Jim Hester, and the many other developers building R packages that help people build R packages.  I would not have gotten this far without those tools to make the process simple. I created the initial version of this package in a matter of days, with limited experience in package development. If I can do it, others can as well.  And it was fun!  In case anyone sees this who is considering building their own package, here are some resources I found helpful. Also for me when I forget where I found something.

* [R packages]("http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz") by Hadley Wickham - He wrote the book on writing R packages (literally)

* R Package Documentation (built with `pkgdown`)
  * Two super helpful pacakges - [usethis]("https://usethis.r-lib.org") & [devtools]("https://devtools.r-lib.org") for package development.
  * [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org) easily create a website for your package & documentation
  
* Blogs
  * General blog post on package development- [Writing an R package fromScratch]("https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/") by Hilary Parker - Great resource I have gone back to many times.  Helped me greatly the first time I looked into package development and I still Google to find this exact blog.

## Contributions

I can't imagine why anyone would contribute to this, but hey it would be cool if you did!  Feel free to submit a pull request or contact me if you want to add something.
