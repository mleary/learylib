The goal of **learylib** is to easily manage a few personal functions and themes I find useful.  A secondary goal is to explore package development in R, using **pkgdown**, **usethis**, & **devtools** to practice fully building out a package. 


## Installation

You can install the latest version of learylib from my Github with the **devtools** package.  Given the limited scope & use of **learylib**, it will always live on Github.

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mleary/learylib")

```

## Usage

Using `theme_leary` with the `mtcars` dataset.

``` {r example1}
library(learylib)
library(ggplot2)
## basic example code

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
     geom_point() +
     labs(title = "A basic example plot",
          subtitle = "A little more detail in subtitle?") +
     theme_leary()
```

Using `see_pkg_funcs` to see all the functions within a package.

``` {r example2}
library(learylib)

see_pkg_funcs(learylib)
```
